# The dynamics of a "Projected Anglular Step Function"

This repository contains the programs used to simulate the application of an iterated step function over triangles.  The application of this function over triangles generates a discrete dynamical system, and this software is used to gain an intuition into the behavior of the system.  The bifurcation diagram represents the dynamics of the system over isosceles triangles.

The `TriangleFunctions.py` is the program used to generate the diagrams, and the different bifurcation diagram notebooks are used to generate variants of the bifurcation diagrams.

The **A Curious Algorithm.pdf** file gives a simple discription of the system, written for a math magazine.
