    "# A Curious Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "During a lecture in a summer calculus class, I took to drawing random geometric patterns around the edges of my notes.  As I was toying with different shapes and ideas for simple space filling curves, I came across an algorithm that happened to result in consistent patterns when drawn within triangles.  Consider this simple algorithm below:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given any triangle, $P$, pick a point anywhere along one of $P$'s edges and call it `current_point`.  \n",
    "2. From `current_point`, draw to the *farthest* edge of $P$, such that the line drawn is perpindicular to the chosen edge.\n",
    "3. Set `current_point` equal to the end of this drawn perpindicular line, and repeat this recursive process for some number of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this \"right angle algorithm\" in detail on paper, I noticed a couple curious properties.  The most prominent property I noticed was that given any \"initial triangle\" and any starting point, the algorithm would quickly converge to some repeating shape, which I will call the \"ultimate shape\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "Interested in finding the exact properties of this ultimate shape and putting my drawing skills to the test, I went home and wrote a program to generate a triangle and implement this right angle algorithm on it, graphing the result.  This write up is a description of what I found when testing this algorithm, highlighting its more interesting features.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Putting the Algorithm to the Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm starts drawing from some point along the edge of the initial triangle, and draws a line to the farthest perpinducular edge, repeating the process from its new location in a recursive manner.  When the algorithm is faced with two equal distances, it randomely picks one of the two edges to draw to.  With this basic understanding of the algorithms' internals, we are equipt to begin the exploration into why it produces the ultimate shapes it does.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Picking an equilateral triangle to begin, I started the algorithm at one of its vertices and let it run for 100 steps, resulting in the graph shown below.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** The function `return_points` takes two angles and the right point of the triangle to build, returning the necessary points to make the triangle with the passed exact angles and right end point.  The function `drawTriangle` takes `(number_of_iterations, starting_point, outer_triangle_points, steps_to_show)` where `number_of_iterations` is the number of steps the algorithm will execute, `starting_point` is where the algorithm will being drawing, `outer_triangle_points` is the set of three points generated by `return_points` to define the outer triangle, and finally `steps_to_show` is the index-range of steps to graph."

    "This project was certainly a lot of fun, however I have many more ideas I would like to explore and questions I would like to have answered.  I list some of these below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions & Exploration**:\n",
    "1. Is it possible to create chosen shapes or patterns by passing the some unique engineered polygon to the algorithm?\n",
    "2. This leads into the question of how this algorithm would respond when applied to higher dimensional shapes.  For example, given some 3D shape, and applying some form of this algorithm to it, will other repeating shapes emerge?  Other repeating shapes similar to the \"outer\" 3D shape?\n",
    "3. In the cases when the algorithm does converge to a triangle, why does it do so?  Specifically, what is special about the \"molding\" characteristics of certain initial triangles that force the ultimate shape into some specific repeating pattern?\n",
    "4. Do the ranges I defined along the lines describe all the isosceles/scalene triangles that have triangular ultimate shapes?\n",
    "5. Is there anything particularly special about the equilateral triangle and its predictable ultimate shape?  Or is the equilateral triangle just a triangle that happens to have a triangular ultimate shape?\n",
    "6. Is there anything particularly special about the critical points that bound the ranges? \n",
    "7. One of the next things I would like to explore is what kind of repeating shapes, if any, this algorithm would produce on any polygon other than a triangle.  For every polygon, does there exists at least one repeating shape that can be developed by applying this algorithm to it?\n",
    "8. I would like to continue searching for an exact formula that can be used to find the side lengths of any interior ultimate triangle given the initial triangle (assuming a formula of this kind exists). \n",
    "9. A fun project I am currently working on is a second program that can be used to recursively nest these \"ultimate triangles\" within eachother, to create some rather visually appealing patterns. \n"
