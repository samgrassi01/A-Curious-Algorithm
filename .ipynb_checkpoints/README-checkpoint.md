# A-Curious-Algorithm

In the "Curious Algorithm" notebook, I implement a simple "right angle" algorithm that produces interesting 
repeating geometric shapes out of triangles.  In the notebook, I analyze some examples of these different shapes,
revealing some interesting patterns and formulas that arise out of the process.

This notebook is intentionally light on both the mathematics and computer science aspects of the process,
as the write up is meant to simply display the interesing shapes this algorithm "comes up with".  To see the
code that I wrote to make the algorithm, see `TriangleFunctions.py`.
